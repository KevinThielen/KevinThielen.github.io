## Introduction

Hey there, 

here is my first post of hopefully many. I'm currently trying to make a habit out of drawing, so I draw daily.
I'm going to upload my drawing on a daily basis, just to track my process for myself and keep track of my thoughts. Maybe it might be interesting for one or another, or even inspiring, to follow my progress. I'm going to upload every single insignificant piece, at least for now. Disclaimer, I'm writing these posts from the future ;) (end of day 6 to be exact).


I don't like drawing at all. It feels kinda boring for me. I'm way too impatient and always get frustrated with the lack of my skills.
Right now I try to be completely independent on the outcome and just draw. To be honest, this all started cause of the nice weather. I kinda felt lite leaving my room and I just took my sketchbook with me to doodle around.

I've tried to create art for my games in the past, but I always got frustrated with the results before I dropped it again. This piece is my best piece so far. To be honest, it looks kinda okayish, but I've probably spent more than 6 hours into it..

## Great start..
I've tried to draw some random character. I've tried to start doing it loosely from my wrist and tried to make some rough lines.. And got immediately disappointed and wanted to throw in the towel..

## Day 1 Exercises

 Well, I just went outside, so I just might as well do the exercise from [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) that I read about months ago, when I had another art-itch. It was something like that, right?

Okay, that was boring and no superpowers yet. I just half-assed a few more exercises before I went back inside..

## Attempt at digital art

Well, I did some exercises. I basically took-off my weights, like some Taijutsu-master, so the real art can begin, right? Well, that was probably my thoughts(or something similiar), when I attempted to copy some of my fav anime characters with my intuos pen & touch M in Gimp..

Well, that wasn't what I was expecting.. Maybe the lines are just way too sketchy. I should try to do it with another brush.

I stopped and decided to call it a day..
