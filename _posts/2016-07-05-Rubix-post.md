## About the Game
Rubix is a simple puzzlegame inspired by Rubik's Cube.
The goal is to rotate the boxes until the color of all cells match in the octagons. 
The game runs on Windows, Linux and webbrowsers. 

The game was written in a month as a simple project to test and improve my custom OpenGL engine.
Several features were added to my engine along the project, like the Graphics-System, Input, Audio and WebGL/Javascript export via Emscripten.

The entire game inlcuding the graphics are made by me.
