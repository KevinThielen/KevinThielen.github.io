## About the Game
ORBZ was created for the Ludum Dare 34 as part of the 48-hour competition, during December 12th-13th, 2015.
The themes for the gamejam were "Two Button Controls" and "Growing".

The goal of the game is to punch the enemies coming from the sides and grow the meter. With each upgrade, the weapon will grow, but so will the characters ego. 
His attacks will become more difficult to time. The game is over when the characters gets hit, or passes all stages of his weapon.

The game was written as a test game for my Game Engine and runs on Windows/Linux and webbrowsers.

The entire game inlcuding the graphics and sounds are made by me.
I worked the first 24 hours on the entire game code and used the 2nd day to create the art,
sounds and some graphical effects.
