Slow and steady wins the race. My last reference-copies weren't that bad, so I definitely should be capable of creating my own good looking pieces, at least in theory. So I probably should start with proper training.. Back to some line control exercises! But I do them digitally. I let something run on my 2nd stream and start working..
