## About the Game
NinjaDash is a small action runner. The player has to concentrate to deflect all incoming projectiles, except the cute little animals.
The entire game is played by tapping at the right time on the screen.

After certain thresholds, the opponent begins to throw cute animals, different patterns, feints and variations. The player loses the game if he either gets hit by a projectile, or tries to cut an animal. The game keeps track of the players highscore.

It was written by me on a single weekend using the Unity engine.
