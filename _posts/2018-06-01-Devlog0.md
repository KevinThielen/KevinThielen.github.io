## Introduction

Hey there! 
Welcome to my little blog.

I'm currently in the middle of rewriting my game engine from the ground up and thought I would use this opportunity to share the process with you! My previous engine was written in C++/OpenGL 4 years ago and used [emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) to export it to the web. Though, in the end it was frankensteined into a monstrosity and stuff like webGL and even 3D rendering were just an afterthought. Especially the CMakeLists got unwieldy in the end(this was even before "modern" CMake). Instead I used Unity for the past years. Now I want to go back building my own engine. 

I used my engine to build small games and game jam entries:

This time I want to update its foundation(using modern CMake) and build for webGL from the start, while also adding support for android.
I'm by no means and expert on this subject and I'm going to learn tons of new things. So take everything I type with a grain of salt ;)


## Writing an engine in 2018?
Engines like Unity and Unreal are already decent and are just getting better and faster with each update.
What's the point of a custom game engine in this day and age?

If you just want to develop your game(s) and an existing engine covers all your needs(or you are willing to accept their quirks), then by all means use an existing engine!
There is no shame in that! Don't let some elitists tell you otherwise. 

However, there are multiple reasons for rolling your own engine that you want to consider for your own project.

### You are in control
Big engines have **hundreds** of professionals working on them full-time.  
How can you with your own hobby-engine, built in your spare time, compete with those giants?  
**Spoiler**: You can't. Well, at least not directly. 

To be fair, it's not a fair comparison in the first place. General purpose engines are just that, *general purpose* engines. They are not designed for a specific use-case, but to appeal to a broad range of games. That's also why they carry a huge amount of luggage around, which makes adjusting them for special needs kinda unwieldy or impossible. A multiplayer zombie survival game for PC has different needs than a fighting game or an isometric SRPG for the web. This kind of flexibility provided by the big engines doesn't come without a cost!


For example, when I was working on my Tactics-Game in Unity, I wanted to go with multiple dynamic light sources for those fancy effects. I was kinda surprised when I found out that it wasn't possible to use deferred lighting with an orthographic camera. I could have used forward rendering, but the impact on the performance was huge. I stumbled over [this reply on the Unity forums](https://forum.unity.com/threads/deferred-lightning-impossible-on-orthographic-camera.117884/#post-942749), which is a great example for one of the trade-offs you have to make. 

> Yes, it's an unfortunate performance choice we had to do - deferred does not work with orthographic cameras. The reason was that we did not want to slow down perspective+deferred case just to make it possible to use orthographic projection. -Aras-

It's not just Unity. All engines have their quirks. There are no perfect solutions! Each engine is basically just an accumulation of trade-offs.   
In my opinion, that's the biggest advantage of creating your own engine from scratch. **You** are the one in control of those trade-offs. Not the company that wants to cater to the majority of users or (for you) irrelevant platforms(like fricking Tizen). **You** decide what you need, no one else. 


### Reinventing the wheel

Some people like to compare writing your engine from scratch with reinventing the wheel, which is kinda misleading in my opinion.
The wheel is a **perfect** invention. I wouldn't go as far as calling Unity, Unreal, or any other big engine _perfect_..

If you want to use the wheel as an analogy, it would be better to see the "wheel" as the concept of game engines in general. Unreal Engine is **a** type of wheel, while Unity is another kind of wheel. They are not **THE** wheel, but **A** wheel. A bike uses different wheels than a car or a wheelchair. There are even implementations pushing the original idea behind the wheel, like cogwheels. So you are not doing something grand like reinventing the wheel, you are "just" building your own type of wheel. A general purpose wheel could work for you, but a special wheel tailored to your needs will do a better job. Maybe the "general" wheel will break because it's not suitable for your needs and you have to band-aid it with duct tape(Woo-Oo!). Even worse you might end up stranded along the way, unable to continue. Even if you are able to reach your goal, general wheels will take away a bit from the actual experience of the people driving your vehicles. The roads feel more bumpy and the wheels won't have as much grip, compared to your special wheels. 

Ideally, your engine is **_THE_** wheel for your game, or at least pretty close to it. That's why I advice against "general purpose" engines, when it comes to custom ones. There is a good chunk of things that can be reused, but sometimes it makes sense to adjust the engine itself to your new needs. Take that Unity example from above, if your game A requires an orthographic camera and game B a perspective one, you can just replace that part of Engine A and call it Engine B.(well, unless all you have to do is to change your projection matrix..). 

That said, it's totally fine(and encouraged) to leverage existing libraries to deal with the stuff you don't have or want to deal with(or at least not right now) and replace when there is an actual need to do so. If there is a solution that is pretty close to perfect for your needs, spending time to reproduce those libs on your own is rather wasted time, unless you want to treat it as a learning experience. [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/), [stb libs](https://github.com/nothings/stb), [tiny headers](https://github.com/RandyGaul/tinyheaders), etc are all helpful. For this project, I'm going with [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) for window and context creation, stb_image to load images, [freetype](https://www.freetype.org/) for my fonts and whatever else I'll see fit down the line. 

### The Joy of Programming 

![The Joy of programming](https://d3pp9vry0n4qq1.cloudfront.net/api/media/1200/1200/100/afae1adbe646966cc9b48ba9ba79aa65.jpg)*(source: http://abstrusegoose.com/467)*

Programming is fun! Writing your own engine is fun! You can try out so many different interesting things, because you are in full control. Want to jump on some new tech hype-train?
Want to pre-allocate your entire memory budget at the start of the game? Want to try programming without OOP and try out this fancy DOP? Want to hotload your code? Want to add functionality via building blocks, that are just .dll's dropped next to your game(which also enables modding)? The possibilities are endless! Not only will those experiments help you to grow as programmer, you can also make the engine truly your _own_. You also don't have to use the style forced on you by an existing engine or be limited by the supported OS or outdated language versions.
You can program however you like, in your favorite IDE, in whatever style you enjoy the most! 

### Iteration is key

The biggest argument against writing a custom engine is definitely the time consumption. It's definitely not taking years, but it will still take away a good chunk of time that could've spent on the game itself. So it's always necessary to weight the advantages with the time requirement and then decide if a custom engine is really worth it for your personal use-case. 

However, the biggest advice I have is to start small and be lazy. Don't worry about "proper architecture". Worry about making it work somehow first. For example, the developers of the game Celeste released their [player class](https://github.com/NoelFB/Celeste/blob/master/Source/Player.cs) recently. At first glance it looks horrible. 5.5k loc and severe violations of the SOLID-principles? States, animations, movement, physics, and visual effects all in the same class? It goes against everything that schools teach you about proper software-architecture. Yet, when looking at the code itself, it's evident the programmer(s) know their stuff. The code itself is clean and understandable. It's divided into logical regions and comments are actually useful. That doesn't mean you should write code like a madman or put everything in a single monolithic file, but if that is what it takes to get your game done in a timely manner, then so be it. 

My advice is to start with a *small* game, while developing the engine alongside it. If you've notice any smelly parts while using your engine, write them down and fix them *after* your game is done, unless they are preventing you from finishing your game. Then repeat the process with the next game, while continuously adding new features and gradually increasing the scope. In the end, you'll end up with a proven, usable engine and a few finished games. My biggest regret in my game development path is, that I've spent too much time on my first engines(back in the days of Directx9) and I ended up with a broken mess and nothing to show, except some really basic tech demos. Your focus should always be on the game, even if you just want to make the tools to create a game.  

You want to start small. Your first engine will suck(as will your first game). However, that's okay!
Your n+1-th engine will take far less time than the one before! Your knowledge and codebase will grow with each iteration, which will allow you to target more and more ambitious games, without spending "years" on your engine.

## Cacatuidae

That's the name of my engine(Those crested winged beings are just adorable!)    
I want to put a special focus on webGL and have a pleasant webGL <-> desktop experience.
My goal is to have playable ads for my games, that will directly link to the storefront. 
Basically bite-sized demos that you can play in your browser, even from your smartphone, ideally with converting save files over.
I'll also use it as a base for the engine of my 3D tactics game.

I could just write the games in JavaScript, but that would have a negative impact on the desktop and mobile experience(let alone my sanity). So I'll go with C++(with some restrictions I'll talk about another time). 

The target platforms will be Desktop(Windows, Linux), webGL(via emscripten) and Android(via native-activity, not a single line of (self-written) Java-code, yay!). I also want to look into ways to support the Nintendo DS at some point for my tactics game, though that's for later.

The next articles will be about creating a modern CMake setup, adding a CI pipeline with automated testing and then android and webGL support, before going into the actual engine code and beginning with the first game. I want to make a few smaller games to test a few things, before I'll tackle my main project, the multiplayer tactics game.

New articles are released every Friday, so stay tuned!
