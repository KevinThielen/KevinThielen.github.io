## Warmup exercise

As I said yesterday, I'm just using a single exercise sheet as warmup this time.

## Just heads

I want to break down characters piece by piece. So for now I start with the heads..
Okay, I'll make a better use of all that negative space in the future.. However, I'm genuinely having fun right now..
Just doing one random head after another.

## And a body

For the last head, I wanted to also attach a body on it, just because I felt like it.

This concludes day 6, and we are at the present now. For the first time I'm having a blast drawing. Tomorrow I'll might start with some serious studies, or not. Depending on how I feel ;)
