## Copy by reference again

I started this day by drawing from a few more references. Rin from my favorite VN Fate/Stay Night and good old Saitama.

I don't know about you, but I feel like Saitama came more naturally to me for some reason ;)

## Anatomy

Now, by confidence got boosted again, so it's time to do some anatomy study.. Or at least I thought it would count as anatomy study..

I just drew a single body an avoided feet and fingers, but for me it was a successful exercise..

## Attempting OC again

I copied, did a study, so now I'm ready to draw my first OC, right? This character should be some cyberish-girl for an endlessrunner game, that's all about speed.

It's not bad. I mean it has an entire body and I didn't get frustrated.. Proportions are still off and arms/legs are just tubes, but.. I better call it a day for now..
