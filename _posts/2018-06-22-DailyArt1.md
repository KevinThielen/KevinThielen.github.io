## Copy by reference
I saw some twitch streamer doing art and kinda got the itch to try it again, despite my fail yesterday. 
I felt like I'm not ready for digital art yet, so I went back to my sketchbook. I looked up some random anime girl and tried to copy it. If I copy it, I might try to figure out the art-flow.. How to draw those lines, right? I can make it unique after figuring out the secret behind great art.. I'm not going to trace it, I just look at it reaaaally carefully and move my pen according to what I see.

## Fail

It wasn't too shabby. It's rough, but it resembles *something*. Alright, now my confidence is boosted and I can create my unique art now. I want to create this super-hero character for my game, so..

Okay, that was horrible.. I got frustrated again. My thoughts went into a defensive pattern again. Why bother with art, just stay with programming and hire an artist..

## Fun

Alright, a few minutes later I wanted to give it another try. Probably because said stream was still open and I got the itch again..

What is that? It was supposed to be another attempt at the super-hero character. However, the head already turned out weird, so I added a doopy mouth and pikachu-cheeks. Then for some reason I got into it and drew that worm body and gave it eve a little sheriff badge. I even gave him a name in all weird styled letters. Pinto - The Worman.. It wasn't good, but for some reason it felt kinda fun and not frustrating..
